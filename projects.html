 The Free Cart by Brynne Paiva (written for APEL)
  </p>
   <p>  Every Sunday at noon, I roll out what I and the other used bookstore volunteers call “the free cart.” As I place the dinky, grey cart in front of the expansive library overlooking the sea, I cannot help but consider how the bland book cart sullies the landscape. A faded, red sign hangs by one piece of tape, the shelves droop under the weight of the books, a box of crinkled, torn magazines sits on top. The cart bears nonfiction texts only; every genre of fiction tends to have a wide enough audience to merit selling a book for one or two bucks, but a large majority of nonfiction books appeal only to an ultra-specific audience, so few will pay. As a result, the free cart houses the old, the tattered, the nearly useless. A computer manual from the nineties rubs shoulders with “A Guide to the Five Best Restaurants in Indianapolis.”
For the longest time, I despised placing the free cart in front of the store. Not only is it ugly, but watching customers sort through the outdated, purely informational texts felt like watching someone order way too much food at a restaurant. There’s no way the customers need each of the books they choose, and it seems that all I do by putting the cart out is contribute to a hoarding problem. 
Of course, there’s a premise to the cart. Why waste these books, let them fill up landfills, when there is a small chance that they will be a treasure to someone? The purpose of the free cart is not to provide reading material for those who cannot afford it; it sits directly in front of a public library (free books) in a neighborhood of multi-million dollar houses. So the small used bookstore displays the free books, hoping that this trash could be a treasure if placed in the right hands. 
Whether its due to the ratty sign or the idea that things are better when you don’t have to pay for them, the free cart calls to endless treasure hunters.
An older woman in a Donna Karen jacket visits the free cart every weekend I work. I watch her dig through the gossip magazines from two years ago. She finds a particularly interesting issue of US Weekly—maybe the issue when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their divorce—and stuffs it in her purse. She looks at the spine of every book of the cart before taking her pick. Never greedy, she always takes only one or two. One day, she grabbed an instruction manual for English horseback riding, mostly just full of photos of how to sit on the horse and hold the reins. She seems content with her find, as if it was exactly what she was looking for.
In the afternoon, after a thirty-something male customer has browsed the store, unable to find a book he wants to buy, he makes his way toward the free cart as a last resort. After touching the spines of all the old books, he finds his treasure: the “Fiske Guide to Colleges: 2001.” It’s tucked under his arm as he bounds toward his car, satisfied to have something in his hands. 
Other scavengers pick at the cart throughout the day, taking whatever five-pound medical guide or outdated sociology textbook appeals to them. I restock the shelves often. Sometimes, if I wait too long and the cart looks empty, people will ask if I “have any more free books in the back.” 
The free cart is an obsession.
Our bookstore runs on donations, so people drop off boxes of books throughout the day, which I bring to the backroom and sort. Due to the inventory stickers we put on our books, I always notice when the free cart books get donated back months later. What is funny to me is that right after these customers donate their originally free books, they shuffle right back to the free cart to look for more. 
As I spend my days alphabetizing endless paperbacks, I mull over the attention the free cart gets from community where the sea is visible from almost every porch. 
Of course, wealthy people love filling their bookshelves to seem more worldly and intelligent, but books like “The Power of Greens” published in the 1980s don’t impress. The free cart books aren’t coffee table books either: the front cover of “The Power of Greens” displays a stock photo of broccoli against a white background.Still, customers flock to the free books in a desperate search, though I never knew what for.
As I sat in third period after lunch one day, however, it became clear. My friends and I had spent the entire lunch period planning a trip we want to take during the summer after our senior year. We decided on a Europe trip first, stopping in little French towns and making our way down to the Italian countryside. Remembering the pure white coasts of Santorini, we arranged an excursion to the Mediterranean Coast. By the time the bell rang for third period, we were traveling all over Europe, Asia, and parts of South America during an eight-week break.
This planning was purely indulgent. Due to summer classes, jobs, and parents, the small French towns and Mediteranean coast are highly unlikely. 
About as unlikely as the woman in the Donna Karen as that woman learning to ride English horseback. 
Picking up a free book is a half hearted-investment in yourself. In fact, it is the smallest investment you can make. By grabbing that book, the woman in Donna Karen has the option of learning to ride English horseback, and I hope she does learn. But, more often than not, that book is going to be right back in my hands in a year when she watches Marie Kondo and decides the object doesn’t spark happiness, instead seeing the book as  a reminder of lost potential. The younger man with the outdated guide to colleges can flip through the pages, learn about the schools, maybe look into a few. But, considering that he ignored the most recent edition of Fiske’s guide for one dollar inside, how confident is he in his future education?
Every free book taken offers the same ephemeral hope I find in my travel fantasies, each book offering the freedom of possibility.
Humans live under the pretense that if we just get enough money, meet the right people, live in the right place, we can do everything we want—but we learn that this isn’t true. There is only enough time to have a few jobs, live in a few places, have a few hobbies. There is still solace in knowing we have the resources and the options to do more; the book to help us learn Windows 5.
 Yet we won’t invest even a dollar in these dreams. There are only a few life choices we can truly invest in, and English horseback riding is normally not one of them—so we make ourselves feel better by picking up a free book. The book sits on our shelf, a constant reminder of the possibilities, a guise of freedom. 
Even as a sixteen year old, my options for what I can and cannot do are already dwindling. As I take more and more humanities classes and less STEM-oriented ones, my chances of becoming an engineer grow increasingly more slim than my chances of becoming a washed-up English major. Still, I’m tied down far less than a forty-year old mother with a steady job. Our options crumble as we become more focused, and we are left in a frantic search for more seemingly practical passageways to these indulgent dreams. A book, for example, rather than a naive conversations with your friends. No guilt can accompany this fantasy either. It’s free.

 An article I wrote about my friend, Izzah. Published in The Nexus.
  </p>
  <p>
 A man struggles to load boxes into his car in the Home Depot parking lot. Izzah Kamran (11) and her mother, both Muslim women, walk by without helping, like many of us would. Kamran and her mother, however, worry about this interaction the whole car ride home—they worry about how the stranger views them now, what conclusions he has drawn about their culture. 
“I felt really bad because I knew helping him was the right thing to do, but also because I didn’t want him to think that all Muslims act like that,” Kamran said. “I don’t want him to think that all Muslims aren’t helpful, or that all Muslims are secluded because my mom and I are normally very helpful, open people—it was just that one time. We were really concerned because we would usually help. Moments like [that] where we make a slip up, I don’t want to be reflective of the entire religion.”
According to Kamran, just by being in public she feels as though she represents her religion, for she wears her religion wrapped around her head and in her long sleeves.
The religion she represents, though, is victim to many misconceptions in the United States, leaving Kamran especially conscious of her behavior in public.
“Sometimes I’m overly nice because I know I’m representing 1.8 billion people,” Kamran said. “ I know that people look at me differently, so I want to make the best of that. I know people will automatically associate me with the entire religion so I feel it's my responsibility to represent my religion to the best of my abilities.”
According to a Pew Research Survey from 2018, 91% of U.S. born Muslims and 65% of Muslim immigrants say there is a lot of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S. 
Living in the relatively tolerant area of San Diego, Kamran said it is not often that she faces hate or obvious discrimination due to her Muslim appearance. 
Curiosity from strangers, however, is prevalent any time Kamran is out in public—evident in glances that linger a bit longer than normal.
“I think Muslims are this almost mystical group that Americans see on the news a lot, usually connected to something bad,” Kamran said. “I don’t blame anyone for being curious, especially if all they are being told about Muslims are these bad things. For the most part, I think I just get looks from people who have maybe never met a Muslim before or don’t see many people wearing a hijab. I don’t think it’s a form of hate.”
Even 18 years after the tragedy, Kamran said she believes many Americans still associate her religion with 9/11.
“Whenever someone—a teacher or something—mentions 9/11, I feel like all eyes turn to me,” Kamran said. “Whether it is deliberate or not, I can just feel it. Wearing the hijab affects that. I know a lot of people who stopped wearing their hijab after 9/11 because they drew so much attention. I wasn’t even alive during 9/11 and people still connect me to it because of how I look.”
Usually, the attention to her dress is well-intentioned. At school, a lot of Kamran’s peers will ask her questions about it.
Questions such as: Are you hot in that? Do you sleep in your hijab? Do you take it off when you get home?
Kamran is often enthusiastic about providing these answers.
“I don’t want people to be afraid to ask me questions,” Kamran said. “I like when people ask me questions rather than just assuming things about me or my religion or my culture.”
Yet, according to Kamran, some questions she has received are slightly more outrageous.
For example, a peer has asked her: “If all of your scarves are dirty, what do you wear?”
“That’s such a funny question because I have so many scarves,” Kamran said. “That’s like asking ‘If all of your t-shirts are dirty, what do you wear?’ My scarves are just a part of my outfit, just an item of clothing, like anybody else wears.”
Most often, Kamran is asked whether she is forced to wear it. 
In some Muslim families, wearing a hijab and long sleeves is enforced by fathers and husbands, which many view as a type of oppression. For Kamran, wearing the hijab is a personal choice.
“It’s ironic because my dad is actually more worried about me wearing it than I am,” Kamran said. “He was hesitant for me to wear my hijab full time and would tell me to maybe take it off after school. After I made my decision, though, he was supportive.”
For Kamran, choosing to wear the hijab felt natural, and her parents have always supported her.
“I think my job as a parent is to fully educate my kids and give them the best knowledge,” Ruhi Kamran, Izzah’s mother, said. “Then, I leave the decision to them—I don’t need to force anything on my daughter. I trust her enough and think she is mature enough to make her own decisions, so I supported her.”
The idea that all Muslim families force women to wear a hijab is often wrongly associated with Islamic religion as a whole, for it is only an aspect of specific Muslim cultures. According to Kamran, many people assume she is forced to wear her hijab because of her religion.
Kamran attributes this stereotype to a lack of exposure Americans have to the wide variety of Muslim cultures.
When Americans see or hear only about certain Islamic countries on the news— for example, Saudi Arabia— they often draw hasty conclusions about Kamran’s religion and culture. According to Kamran, many Americans assume that Islam is inherently oppressive due to news stories about Saudi Arabia, but this is simply untrue.
Despite the looks, the questions, and the assumptions that accompany her choice, wearing the scarf— and, in turn, representing her religion—  is essential to her identity, according to Kamran.
Whereas many people dream that they go out in public without clothes on, Kamran often dreams that she is in public without her hijab.
“It is a part of who I am,” Kamran said. “If I didn’t wear [a hijab] in public, it would feel like I was lying. I just love wearing it. I recognize [my scarf] as a part of me because it is the thing that connects me to my culture. Its also more special than any other clothing item I wear because it’s an indication of me exercising my right to freedom of expression”
In the media, however, the hijab is often represented in the opposite fashion: as a tradition despised by Muslim girls.
One representation that has always stood out to Kamran was in the TV series, “Degrassi: The Next Generation,” which ran from 2001 to 2015. 
“Shows like ‘Degrassi’ always show Muslim girls questioning their identity and whether they should be wearing the scarf or not,” Kamran said. “I know some Muslims go through that, but I don’t think it’s the majority. These shows make it seem like all Muslim girls struggle with their identity and want to take off their scarf. The girls in the shows take off their scarves and feel so liberated. I feel liberated putting it on.”
When Kamran puts on her scarf, she said she feels as though she is given an opportunity to show people that Muslims are more than what they see on TV. For that reason, she has never regretted her choice to wear the hijab.
“I am proud to show off to people who I am,” Kamran said. “I want to be a person who can be a good representation of the Muslim community. That’s one of my main goals in everything I do.”
As Kamran chooses, every morning, to wear her hijab, she is choosing faith.
“I feel empowered when I wear it because I choose to,” Kamran said. “By doing so, I can strengthen my faith and show that I’m unapologetically Muslim.”
